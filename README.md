# Simulation-Modeling-with-Machine-Learning
The project demonstrate how to incorporate simulation modeling with machine learning techniques.

The simulation of emergency department is implemented in RockWell Arena.

Abstract of the paper:

Emergency department (ED) crowding is characterized by the shortage of
medical resources and the prolonged patient waiting time. Here we analyzed
the emergency department from a systemic point of view. We summarized
the possible leverage points in the ED system, and reviewed previous
studies targeting these critical points. In addition, we developed a decision
forest-based machine learning classifier, which can be used for patient
assessment. Our simulation showed adding this classifier into the ED
system greatly reduced patient â€™ s waiting time. Our study suggested
machine learning as a promising solution that leverages the ED efficiency at
multiple points.
